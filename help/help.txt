[-] In Player x Player mode it is necessary to enter the nickname of both players 
that will participate in the match.

[-] A report is generated at the end of each match and contains general 
information about that match. These reports are generated in the reports 
directory with certain identification codes for each report.

[-] The clear-reports script located inside the reports directory has the 
functionality to delete all previously generated reports and use it when necessary.

[-] There is another script that is interesting to use and makes reading 
reports easier - the read-report script is used to read reports generated 
from your ID code. Use ./read-report -h to understand how to use it.
