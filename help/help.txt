[-] A general report of each game is always generated at the end of a match with an 
identification code. The reports are saved in the <reports> directory.

[-] There are two important scripts: clear-reports and read-reports. 
The clear-reports script serves to delete all previously generated reports 
within the <reports> directory. The read-report script is used to read a 
specific report from its identification code and to use it run the script 
by sending a valid identification code as parameter.
